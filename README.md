# Pong-Game
I've made a basic Pong game using 'Pygame' library.

It's a two player game, controls will be displayed at the start of the game.

The score I've set to win the the game is 10 points, you can change this value and the ball speed as well.

You can also change some of the code to set 'Player 2' to be played by Computer. You can integrate a simple AI for this.

# To play this game, make sure your computer has python installed and using 'pip', install pygame. Run the script, then you are good to go, Have Fun.
